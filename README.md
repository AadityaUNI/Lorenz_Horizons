# Lorenz Horizon

## About the Project
This is a visual Lorenz Attractor Model Simulator which offers the user full control over the parameters - Sigma, Beta & Rho, along with initial positions.

The App allows simulating two lorenz models in a 3d interactive plotly graph:


And another feature the user can explore is the **Predictability Horizon**:

This is defined (by me) as the earliest time at which the correlation between two Lorenz trajectories falls below a fixed threshold and remains below that threshold for a sustained duration, indicating a persistent loss of reliable predictability rather than a transient fluctuation.

For the example shown above, the horizon plot demonstrating the threshold (horizontal -- line) and the time (vertical red line) at which the horizon is significantly crossed:


This project was purely motivated by personal curiosity within lorenz attractor systems and to understand (and tinker with) the different values of the constants pertaining to different system behaviors, along with an added research feature as my own twist.
